It provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of geophysics and hydrology, equipping students with the foundational knowledge to address environmental and water resource challenges. Students will explore geophysical methods such as electromagnetic and seismic techniques, emphasizing techniques essential for investigating the subsurface in environmental science. Additionally, the module covers essential hydrological concepts, including water fluxes, storage processes, and key methods for water resource management, enabling students to evaluate sustainable water use strategies effectively. Together, these two lectures introduce students to the study of the critical zone, the thin skin of the Earth’s surface.",

Building on this foundation, students will achieve the following learning outcomes:\n\nIdentify and describe basic geophysical methods commonly used in environmental science.\nUnderstand fundamental principles and physical concepts underlying geophysical exploration techniques, particularly electromagnetic and seismic methods.\nExplain how geophysical data can be used to analyze environmental conditions and assess basic environmental risks.\nRecognize the strengths and limitations of various geophysical techniques in environmental applications.\n\n\n\nb) Lecture: Physical Hydrology\nThe primary objective of this lecture is to introduce students to the foundational concepts of hydrology and basic methods used in water resource management, preparing them to assess the potential and limitations of different water uses. Upon completing this module, students will be able to:\n\nExplain the fundamental concepts of hydrology, including water fluxes and storage processes.\nIdentify key hydrological methods used in water resource management.\nAssess the potential and limitations of various water uses, considering the governing processes of water fluxes and storage.\nDiscuss basic hydrological processes and their implications for water resource management.",

It is an opportunity for students to develop research skills and/or gain professional expertise as well as academic knowledge. Students are expected to begin planning their internship early in the semester to ensure a timely placement and registration. While the timing of the internship may vary depending on individual arrangements, it should be aligned with the study plan and registered with the IMES Office before commencement. Students are encouraged to find their own internship placements and make initial contact with prospective organizations, as this builds communication and organizational skills. The IMES Office can provide guidance in certain cases and share a database of former internship hosts but does not guarantee placement. The module includes a seminar in which students present and reflect on their internship experiences. This setting provides a structured opportunity for peer-to-peer learning, constructive feedback, and academic exchange. Students are expected not only to defend their own internship work but also to engage actively with the presentations of their peers by asking questions, giving feedback, and discussing diverse professional contexts relevant to environmental sciences.",

    "text": "a) Master Thesis\nThe Master’s thesis is an independent academic examination designed to demonstrate the candidate’s ability to address a well-defined problem within the field of study using appropriate scientific methods within a specified timeframe. The thesis may be completed in any subject of the IMES program and must be written in English.\nThroughout the thesis phase, students receive individual academic supervision. Supervisors provide feedback on the exposé, guidance during the research and writing process, and support for the mid-term presentation. This structure is designed to help students manage their time effectively and produce work of high academic quality.\nAt the beginning of the thesis process, students are required to submit an exposé (approximately 2–4 pages), outlining the research question, objectives, theoretical background, methodology, and expected structure of the thesis. The exposé must demonstrate the feasibility and academic relevance of the project and serves as the basis for discussion and feedback with the supervisor.\nApproximately halfway through the working period, a mid-term presentation is mandatory. In this presentation, the student presents their progress and discusses preliminary results in a seminar with their supervisors and peers. Both the exposé and the mid-term presentation are ungraded coursework (“Studienleistungen”) and must be passed.\nThe maximum timeframe for completing the Master’s thesis is six months from the date the topic is assigned. The thesis should not exceed 100 A4 pages.\nFurther details on the Master’s thesis are provided in the examination regulations (§21).\n\n\nb) Colloquium (Oral defense of the master’s thesis)\nThe colloquium is conducted as an interdisciplinary individual examination. The candidate presents the contents of their Master’s thesis in a 10- to 15-minute presentation, followed by questions and discussion with the examiners. The colloquium lasts between 40 and 60 minutes. Students and staff of the IMES program are permitted to attend the colloquium unless the candidate objects. Participation of observers does not include the deliberation or announcement of results.\nFurther details on the Colloquium are given in the examination regulations (§21).",
