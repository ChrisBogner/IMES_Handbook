## Module Description

This module consists of two lectures: *Introduction to Environmental Geophysics* and *Physical Hydrology*. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of geophysics and hydrology, equipping students with the foundational knowledge to address environmental and water resource challenges. Students will explore geophysical methods such as electromagnetic and seismic techniques, emphasizing techniques essential for investigating the subsurface in environmental science. Additionally, the module covers essential hydrological concepts, including water fluxes, storage processes, and key methods for water resource management, enabling students to evaluate sustainable water use strategies effectively. Together, these two lectures introduce students to the study of the critical zone, the thin skin of the Earth's surface.

## Module Objectives and Outcomes

### a) Lecture: Introduction to Environmental Geophysics

The main objective of this lecture is to introduce students to fundamental concepts, methodologies, and basic interpretative techniques of geophysical methods applied in environmental studies. Building on this foundation, students will achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Identify and describe basic geophysical methods commonly used in environmental science.
- Understand fundamental principles and physical concepts underlying geophysical exploration techniques, particularly electromagnetic and seismic methods.
- Explain how geophysical data can be used to analyze environmental conditions and assess basic environmental risks.
- Recognize the strengths and limitations of various geophysical techniques in environmental applications.

### b) Lecture: Physical Hydrology

The primary objective of this lecture is to introduce students to the foundational concepts of hydrology and basic methods used in water resource management, preparing them to assess the potential and limitations of different water uses. Upon completing this module, students will be able to:

- Explain the fundamental concepts of hydrology, including water fluxes and storage processes.
- Identify key hydrological methods used in water resource management.
- Assess the potential and limitations of various water uses, considering the governing processes of water fluxes and storage.
- Discuss basic hydrological processes and their implications for water resource management.
