    "text": "Purpose\nEnvironmental challenges today are multifaceted, systemic, and global in scope. They cannot be addressed by isolated disciplines, isolated geographies or short-term solutions. The International Master of Environmental Sciences (IMES) program responds to this complexity by fostering a learning environment rooted in interdisciplinarity, internationality, scientific inquiry, and anticipatory thinking.\nInspired by the Club of Rome’s vision of No Limits to Learning, the program views education not merely as knowledge transmission, but as a transformative and continuous process. Students are encouraged to integrate perspectives from the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, law, and economics to better understand and engage with human–environment systems. Through this process, they develop the capacity to learn across boundaries — disciplinary, cultural, and institutional — and to respond with creativity and responsibility to emerging environmental challenges.\nAligned with the values articulated in The Fifth Element, the IMES program promotes a systems-based approach to education. It seeks to cultivate not only analytical and methodological competence, but also a sense of responsibility, relational thinking, and openness to regeneration — both ecological and societal. The program cultivates environmental stewardship as a dynamic, reflective practice rooted in scientific insight, ethical awareness, and cross-cultural dialogue. In this way, IMES prepares students to co-create knowledge and solutions in a world that demands profound and continuous learning.",

Core modules introduce key scientific, legal, economic, and social dimensions of human–environment interactions. A set of integrative modules connects these domains, supporting a systems-level understanding of environmental issues.\nThe program fosters an international learning environment through a diverse cohort of students from EU and non-EU countries, and through the participation of guest lecturers from partner institutions worldwide. Students shape their own academic profiles by selecting elective modules that match their interests and career goals, culminating in a Master’s thesis within their chosen focus area.\nA mandatory internship provides practical experience and insight into professional fields related to environmental sciences. Throughout the program, students develop research and methodological skills, scientific communication abilities, and the flexibility to engage with new and complex problems. The program structure allows for a study abroad semester, typically in the third semester, further enriching the international and intercultural dimension of the degree.",

The Master Thesis and Colloquium form a comprehensive research module worth 30 ECTS. The curriculum includes six mandatory modules and a wide range of electives, allowing students to shape their individual academic trajectories.\nModules in IMES are classified into three types:\n\nCore Modules (CM): These modules provide foundational knowledge in essential areas of environmental sciences. They introduce key concepts, methodologies, and frameworks and are typically completed early in the program.\nAdvanced Modules (AM): Building on the Core Modules, these modules allow students to deepen their knowledge, refine their skills, and engage with more complex environmental issues. They encourage independent application of methods and further development of analytical and research competencies.\nSpecialisation Modules (SM): These modules enable students to focus on a specific area of interest within environmental sciences. Specialisation Modules support the development of an individual academic profile and typically correspond with the topic of the Master’s thesis.\n\nDetailed descriptions of each module are provided in the second part of this module handbook.\n\nList of modules in IMES.

It explores how environmental problems have been addressed through legal mechanisms, both historically and in contemporary contexts, including before and after the introduction of dedicated environmental legislation.\nThe lecture International Environmental Law advances students’ understanding of domestic law introduced in lecture a), focusing on international law and its application to global environmental challenges. Students will explore the unique sources, institutions, and subjects of international environmental law, and distinguish them from their domestic counterparts. The course emphasizes the role of treaties, litigation, and arbitration in shaping international environmental governance.",

While the timing of the internship may vary depending on individual arrangements, it should be aligned with the study plan and registered with the IMES Office before commencement. Students are encouraged to find their own internship placements and make initial contact with prospective organizations, as this builds communication and organizational skills. The IMES Office can provide guidance in certain cases and share a database of former internship hosts but does not guarantee placement. The module includes a seminar in which students present and reflect on their internship experiences. This setting provides a structured opportunity for peer-to-peer learning, constructive feedback, and academic exchange.

    "text": "a) Master Thesis\nThe Master’s thesis is an independent academic examination designed to demonstrate the candidate’s ability to address a well-defined problem within the field of study using appropriate scientific methods within a specified timeframe. The thesis may be completed in any subject of the IMES program and must be written in English.\nThroughout the thesis phase, students receive individual academic supervision. Supervisors provide feedback on the exposé, guidance during the research and writing process, and support for the mid-term presentation. This structure is designed to help students manage their time effectively and produce work of high academic quality.\nAt the beginning of the thesis process, students are required to submit an exposé (approximately 2–4 pages), outlining the research question, objectives, theoretical background, methodology, and expected structure of the thesis. The exposé must demonstrate the feasibility and academic relevance of the project and serves as the basis for discussion and feedback with the supervisor.\nApproximately halfway through the working period, a mid-term presentation is mandatory. In this presentation, the student presents their progress and discusses preliminary results in a seminar with their supervisors and peers. Both the exposé and the mid-term presentation are ungraded coursework (“Studienleistungen”) and must be passed.\nThe maximum timeframe for completing the Master’s thesis is six months from the date the topic is assigned. The thesis should not exceed 100 A4 pages.\nFurther details on the Master’s thesis are provided in the examination regulations (§21).\n\n\nb) Colloquium (Oral defense of the master’s thesis)\nThe colloquium is conducted as an interdisciplinary individual examination. The candidate presents the contents of their Master’s thesis in a 10- to 15-minute presentation, followed by questions and discussion with the examiners. The colloquium lasts between 40 and 60 minutes. Students and staff of the IMES program are permitted to attend the colloquium unless the candidate objects. Participation of observers does not include the deliberation or announcement of results.\nFurther details on the Colloquium are given in the examination regulations (§21).",
