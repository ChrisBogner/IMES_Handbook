# The International Master of Environmental Sciences (IMES) {.unnumbered}

## Purpose
Environmental challenges today are multifaceted, systemic, and global in scope. They cannot be addressed by isolated disciplines, isolated geographies or short-term solutions. The International Master of Environmental Sciences (IMES) program responds to this complexity by fostering a learning environment rooted in interdisciplinarity, internationality, scientific inquiry, and anticipatory thinking.

Inspired by the Club of Rome’s vision of [No Limits to Learning](https://www.clubofrome.org/blog-post/bologna-qa-legacy-of-no-limits-to-learning/), the program views education not merely as knowledge transmission, but as a transformative and continuous process. Students are encouraged to integrate perspectives from the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, law, and economics to better understand and engage with human–environment systems. Through this process, they develop the capacity to learn across boundaries — disciplinary, cultural, and institutional — and to respond with creativity and responsibility to emerging environmental challenges.

Aligned with the values articulated in [The Fifth Element](https://thefifthelement.earth/), the IMES program promotes a systems-based approach to education. It seeks to cultivate not only analytical and methodological competence, but also a sense of responsibility, relational thinking, and openness to regeneration — both ecological and societal. The program cultivates environmental stewardship as a dynamic, reflective practice rooted in scientific insight, ethical awareness, and cross-cultural dialogue. In this way, IMES prepares students to co-create knowledge and solutions in a world that demands profound and continuous learning.

## Study Objectives
The IMES program (Master of Science) prepares students to engage in independent, research-based inquiry into environmental challenges at the interface of natural and human systems. Students learn to critically evaluate scientific findings, apply appropriate methodologies, and analyze complex environmental problems from interdisciplinary and international perspectives.

The program fosters the ability to integrate knowledge across environmental sciences, including ecological, legal, economic, and societal dimensions. Students strengthen their scientific writing, presentation, and project management skills while developing the social competencies required to work successfully in transdisciplinary contexts. Through a combination of theoretical depth and applied experience, the IMES program equips graduates for diverse career paths in environmental science and policy, and for academic advancement at the doctoral level.

## Content

IMES is a four-semester, interdisciplinary degree program that combines natural and social sciences to investigate pressing environmental challenges. Core modules introduce key scientific, legal, economic, and social dimensions of human–environment interactions. A set of integrative modules connects these domains, supporting a systems-level understanding of environmental issues.

The program fosters an international learning environment through a diverse cohort of students from EU and non-EU countries, and through the participation of guest lecturers from partner institutions worldwide. Students shape their own academic profiles by selecting elective modules that match their interests and career goals, culminating in a Master’s thesis within their chosen focus area.

A mandatory internship provides practical experience and insight into professional fields related to environmental sciences. Throughout the program, students develop research and methodological skills, scientific communication abilities, and the flexibility to engage with new and complex problems. The program structure allows for a study abroad semester, typically in the third semester, further enriching the international and intercultural dimension of the degree.


## Admission Requirements

# Qualification Profile

## The German Qualifications Framework for Higher Education (HQR)

The *German Qualifications Framework for Higher Education (HQR)* describes the key competencies that students are expected to develop during their studies at German universities. It serves as a national reference for ensuring high academic standards, transparent learning outcomes, and comparability across degree programs—both nationally and internationally.

### Why does the HQR matter?

The HQR plays an important role in:

- **Designing degree programs**: Universities use it to define what students should know and be able to do at different academic levels (Bachelor, Master, Doctorate).
- **Developing modules and assessments**: It helps structure learning outcomes, teaching methods, and examinations.
- **Ensuring international comparability**: The HQR aligns with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and the Qualifications Framework for the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA).
- **Supporting mobility and recognition**: It facilitates credit transfer, student exchange, and mutual recognition of degrees across countries.

### What are the core competence dimensions?

The HQR defines four broad competence areas that every Master's graduate should develop:

- **Knowledge and Understanding**  
  Deep and critical understanding of theories, methods, and debates in the field of study.

- **Use, Application, and Generation of Knowledge**  
  Ability to apply knowledge to new problems and to independently conduct research.

- **Communication and Cooperation**  
  Skills to communicate effectively, work in diverse teams, and engage in academic or professional discourse.

- **Academic Self-Understanding and Professionalism**  
  Capacity for ethical reflection, independent judgement, and responsible professional behavior.

### What does the HQR mean for the IMES program?

The integration of the German Qualifications Framework for Higher Education (HQR) into the IMES program contributes to the academic structure, international comparability, and competence orientation of the degree. Specifically, it ensures that:

- Program outcomes are competence-driven: Each module fosters academic and professional skills across the four HQR dimensions.
- Learning objectives are transparent and structured: Students gain clarity about what they are expected to know and be able to do at each stage of the program.
- The degree is internationally comparable: Alignment with the HQR and European frameworks supports recognition of qualifications beyond Germany.
- Graduates are well prepared: The program equips students for both research careers and applied roles in environmental science, policy, and practice.
- Quality assurance is ensured: The framework supports consistent standards in curriculum development, teaching, and assessment.


## Qualification Profile of IMES

This qualification profile outlines the core competencies expected from graduates of the IMES program. It supports curriculum development, teaching strategies, assessment, and quality assurance.

- Show commitment to life-long learning and critical self-reflection in complex, changing environments.


# Program Structure

## Thematic Categories of the IMES Curriculum
The IMES program is organized into modules—self-contained units of study that integrate related topics into coherent blocks of learning. Each module carries a defined number of ECTS credits and includes clearly articulated learning outcomes and assessments. Most modules are designed to be completed within a single semester, though some may extend across two.

To ensure a broad and interdisciplinary foundation, IMES modules are grouped into five thematic categories. Students are required to complete **at least 6 ECTS credits in each category** as part of the degree requirements:

| **Code** | **Category Name**  | **Topics include, but are not limited to**  |
|------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| A        | Earth and Environmental Systems  | Physical environment, natural sciences, climate, ecosystems                          |
| B        | Societies, Education, and Ethics | Human values, education for sustainability, ethics, cities, resilience               |
| C        | Governance, Law, and Institutions| Environmental law, political systems, regulation, institutions                        |
| D        | Economy and Resource Management  | Environmental economics, renewable energy, resource management                        |
| E        | Research and Analytical Methods  | GIS, statistics, modeling, interdisciplinary methods, research methods               |
